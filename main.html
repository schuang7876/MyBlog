                <p>
                    "A man,a plan,a coffee bean".Okay,that doesn't make a palindrome,but it resulted
                    in a damn good cup of coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about
                    anywhere.And of course,the big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First
                    readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the
                    caffeine needs of a whole new set of customers.
